    value: "# M0 — Foundation & Configuration Setup\n\n## Goal\nEstablish a baseline\
      \ Windows 10+ desktop application that enforces trust boundaries, parses and\
      \ validates configuration, provides a basic WPF UI for configuring roots and\
      \ MetaF installation, and ensures all user‑content I/O occurs within allowed\
      \ roots. This milestone also implements optional integrations gating and ensures\
      \ the UI remains responsive during scanning and configuration.\n\n## In Scope\n\
      - Implement `ConfigService` to load and parse `config.yaml` stored under `APP_CONFIG_DIR`\
      \ with lenient unknown key handling.\n- Validate configuration keys: absolute\
      \ local paths, non‑overlapping fixed volumes, existence and flatness of `MET_SOURCE_DIR`,\
      \ `.git` presence in `AF_REPO_DIR`, and creatability of `APP_WORK_DIR`.\n- Provide\
      \ UI to configure directory roots and MetaF install settings; enforce preview/approval\
      \ gating for actions as a placeholder for later workflows.\n- Implement `BoundaryFileSystem`\
      \ enforcing allowed roots, canonicalization, final‑path checks, and reparse\
      \ point policy.\n- Implement gating flags for VS Code workspace management and\
      \ optional integrations (no blocking if absent).\n- Enforce that conversion\
      \ runs are user‑triggered; no background conversions.\n- Ensure UI offloads\
      \ heavy work off the UI thread for responsiveness.\n\n## Out of Scope\n- Actual\
      \ MetaF installation and execution (handled in M1).\n- Conversion workflows\
      \ (`.met→.af` or `.af→.met`) and Git publish mechanics.\n- Repair mapping or\
      \ relink features.\n- Archive retention enforcement and conflict policies.\n\
      - Final determinism, logging and error handling (deferred to M5).\n\n## Milestone\
      \ checklist\n\n### Acceptance criteria (DoD)\n- [ ] Foundation modules compiled\
      \ without errors and integrated into UI.\n- [ ] All mapping configuration validations\
      \ implemented and verified.\n- [ ] Boundary enforcement passes AT‑0001, AT‑0002\
      \ and AT‑0003.\n- [ ] UI is responsive during configuration and scanning.\n\
      - [ ] Optional integrations gating toggles appear and default to off.\n- [ ]\
      \ Initial documentation and guides published.\n\n### Exit artifacts\n- [ ] Release\
      \ notes entry for baseline features.\n- [ ] Changelog entry describing configuration\
      \ validation and trust boundary.\n- [ ] Test report demonstrating success of\
      \ AT‑0001, AT‑0002, AT‑0003.\n- [ ] Configuration guide published.\n- [ ] Security\
      \ review notes for boundary enforcement.\n\n## Links / evidence\n- Spec sections:\
